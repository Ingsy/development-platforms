## Brief History

In 2003 Bluehost was founded by Matt Heaton and Danny Ashworth. Bluehost is one of the most popular hosting providers in the insustry, and offers various hosting services, with focus on user-friendly features and customer support..... In 2015 Bluehost launched a partnership with WordPress, and offered optimized hosting solutions specifically designed for WordPress-powered websites.

Shared hosting is when multiple websites share the resources of a single server. Shared hosting services is a commen choice for small businesses and websites that only require certain amount of disk space, bandwidth and other resources.

## Weaknesses

In shared hosting multiple websites share the same server. When other websites on the same server experience high traffic or resource demands, it can affect the performance or loading times of your website. Shared hosting also have limitations on server-lever customization. With shared hosting there is still a greater risk, then other hosting services, when it comes to security vulnerabilities, due to the fact that multiple websites share the same server. If one website on the server is compromised, it could potentially affect other websites as well.

scalability...
businesses that host their websites through shared hosting shares CPU, RAM, and bandwidth with other websites.
This sharing allows the hosting provider to offer more affordable plans, but it can also lead to limitations in terms of performance and scalability.
If your once small business, suddenly grows and gets alot more traffic, it might be time to consider to change to a more advanced hosting option, like (VPS) virtual private server or a dedicated server. Bluehost, like most other hosting services, offers different hosting options to suit your needs.  

The Pricing can also be misleading. //Like many hosting providers, Bluehost often offers attractive introductory pricing for the first term of your hosting plan. However, renewal pricing tends to be higher, which means you might pay more when renewing your plan.//
