## Weaknesses
In shared hosting multiple websites share the same server. when other websites on the same server experience high traffic or resource demands, it can affect the performance or loading times of your website. shared hosting also have limitations on sercer-lever customization. The fact that multiple websites share the same server in shared hosting there are risks of security vulnerabilities than other hosting services. If one website on the server is compromised, it could potentially affect other websites as well.
The Pricing can also be misleading. //Like many hosting providers, Bluehost often offers attractive introductory pricing for the first term of your hosting plan. However, renewal pricing tends to be higher, which means you might pay more when renewing your plan.//
