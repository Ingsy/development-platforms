When other websites on the same server experience high traffic or resource demands, it can affect the performance or loading times of your website. Shared hosting also have limitations on server-lever customization. With shared hosting there is still a greater risk, then other hosting services, when it comes to security vulnerabilities, due to the fact that multiple websites share the same server. If one website on the server is compromised, it could potentially affect other websites as well.

Scalability:
businesses that host their websites through shared hosting shares CPU, RAM, and bandwidth with other websites. This sharing allows the hosting provider to offer more affordable plans, but it can also lead to limitations in terms of performance and scalability. If your once small business, suddenly grows and gets alot more traffic, it might be time to consider to change to a more advanced hosting option, like (VPS) virtual private server or a dedicated server. Bluehost, like most other hosting services, offers different hosting options to suit your needs.

Pricing:
The Pricing can also be somewhat misleading. Many shared hosting plans offers attractive introductory pricing for the first term. Renewal pricing is, however useally higher than first terms.

HostGator offers unlimited storage and unmetered bandwidth. DreamHost offers shared hosting plans, with a focus on security and unlimited traffic.
